    <blockquote><p class="leo">The paleo diet claims that modern humans should eat the same foods that their hunter-gatherer ancestors ate — the way humans were genetically designed to eat before agriculture developed.  The theory is that most modern diseases can be linked to the Western diet and the consumption of grains, diary and processed foods. <br> While it's debatable that this diet is comprised of the same foods your ancestors ate, it is linked to several impressive health benefits.</p> </blockquote>
    <dl class="works"> 
        <dt>How It Works?</dt>
       
        <dd>The Paleo diet emphasizes whole foods, lean protein , vegetables, fruits , nuts and seeds, while avoiding processed foods, sugar, diary and grains.<br> Some more flexible versions of the paleo diet also allow for diary like cheese and butter, as well as tubers like potatoes and sweet potatoes. </dd> 
        <dt> Weight Loss</dt>
       
        <dd> Several studies have shown that the paleo diet can lead to significant weight loss and reduced waist size. <br> In studies, paleo dieters have also been shown to automatically eat much fewer carbs, more protein and 300-900 fewer calories per day. </dd>
        <dt>The downside</dt>
       
        <dd>The paleo diet eliminates whole grains, legumes and dairy. Therefore, it unnecessarily eliminates several healthy and nutritious food groups.</dd>
