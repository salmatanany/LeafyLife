                <dt> WHAT IS A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE? </dt>

                <dd> A healthy lifestyle is one which helps to keep and improve your health and well-being.There are many different things that you can do to live a healthy lifestyle, such as eating healthy, being physically active, maintaining a healthy weigh, and managing your stress. However, a healthy lifestyle isn’t just about healthy eating and exercise, it also about taking care of the whole you – your physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. And, that means taking care of you from the inside out.</dd>

                <dt>HOW TO LIVE A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE?</dt>

                <dd>Even though there are many common ways to live a healthy lifestyle, actually doing it looks different for everyone, and means something different from one person to the next. Regardless of what you choose to do, living a healthy lifestyle is a key component to disease prevention, wellness, and longevity. Being mindful of your diet, physical activity and stress levels allows you to effectively balance all aspects of your life and the “whole you”. Below are 10 important things you can do to live a healthy lifestyle:</dd>

                <dt>How Often will I get a workout?</dt>

                <dd>The title personal trainer was derived for a reason. At your initial meeting with your trainer, discuss how often it is you would like to workout. Whether it is once per week or five times per week, your trainer will send you the perfect workout to help you achieve your fitness goals.</dd>

                <dt>What is nutrition?</dt>

                <dd>As molecular biology, biochemistry, and genetics advance, nutrition has become more focused on metabolism and metabolic pathways - biochemical steps through which substances inside us are transformed from one form to another. Nutrition also focuses on how diseases, conditions, and problems can be prevented or reduced with a healthy diet. Similarly, nutrition involves identifying how certain diseases and conditions may be caused by dietary factors, such as poor diet (malnutrition), food allergies, and food intolerances.</dd>

                <dt>Should I Go Gluten-Free?</dt>

                <dd>Only if you have celiac disease, when gluten (a protein in grains) damages your small intestine. Experts no longer think gluten causes rashes, stomachaches, or weight gain in people without the disease. It can’t hurt to skip gluten-rich foods like cookies and white bread. But don’t ditch whole grains unless your doctor says to. They fill you up and are full of healthy nutrients.</dd>

                <dt>Are Short Workouts Worth It?</dt>

                <dd>Yes. Longer is better, but you can get by with quick bouts of activity when that’s all you have time for. The CDC suggests 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week (like walking or biking at a medium-fast pace), plus two sessions of muscle-strengthening exercise. Several 10- minute bursts of exercise each day can get you to this goal and help keep you fit.</dd>

                <dt>Sugar or High Fructose Corn Syrup?</dt>

                <dd>High-fructose corn syrup, which does come from corn, gets a bad rap. But your body processes it almost the same way it does table or regular sugar, which is made from cane or beets. Your best bet is to go easy on both. High amounts of any added sugar can lead to weight gain and problems like high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease.</dd>

                <dt>Does Cholesterol in Food Count?</dt>

                <dd>Obesity, inactivity, and a poor diet can do more to raise your cholesterol than an egg. The real bad guys are the unhealthy trans fats and saturated fats found in meats, dairy, and processed foods. Opt for low-fat dairy and lean meats, read labels, and watch your carbs and portions. If your numbers are high, ask your doctor what foods you should avoid.</dd>
