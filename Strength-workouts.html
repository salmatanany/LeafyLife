<blockquote class="colorp1">Strength training, also known as resistance training,<br> causes contractions of the muscles via external resistance.<br> The resistance can come from using barbells, dumbbells, resistance bands, strength machines <br>or a person's own body weight.<br>Strength training forms tiny, microscopic tears in a person's muscles. <br>As the tears heal the muscles repair themselves with new muscle tissue. <br>By developing new muscle tissue, an individual can improve their aesthetic appearance<br> and transform their physique to make it leaner and more toned.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="colorp">The "V" cut in your abdominal area is one of the most sought after looks. But the first thing you must do when trying to get your abs lean is lower your overall body fat. There is no such thing as spot reduction so if you're hoping for this workout to burn fat off your abs, it's not going to happen. 

But if your body fat is low already and you're trying to build muscle on your obliques to get that "V" cut appearance. Try out these exercises with 30 seconds rest between each one for as many rounds as you can.

1.  Spiderman Plank Crunch - Roll your shoulders out to stabilize your body, keep your body in a straight line and drive one knee outward and up to your elbow while crunching at the midsection. To make this harder, you can implement a pushup with the crunch.

2. Rotating Leg Lift Extensions - Starting position is with your back on the ground and legs up towards the ceiling. Once here, you will bring your butt/lower back off the ground by extending your legs towards the ceiling.. But while you do this, make sure you are implementing the twist of your hips otherwise it will only target lower abs and not obliques.

3. Floor Wipers - Starting in the same position as the leg lift extensions except with your arms out to the side for shoulder stabilization. From there, you will lower your legs down to one side until your feet are about 2 inches off the ground and you will bring your legs back up to starting position. Make sure you are focusing on engaging your obliques here and not using your upper body to power your leg movement.

4. Bicycles - Lay on your back with your legs out straight, your hands behind your head and your elbows out to the side. From here you will bring one knee up and one elbow down to meet that knee. What you want to focus on here is the twisting and crunching of your ABS! Imagine as if you are trying to get your shoulder to touch your knee so that you're not cheating your way through the exercise.</blockquote>
