             Low-carb diets have been populor for many decades, especially for weight loss. <br> There are several types of low-carb diets, but all of them involve limiting <br>
             carb intake to 20-150 grams of net carbs per day. The primary aim<br>
             of the diet is to force the body to use more fats for fuel, instead of<br>
             using carbs as a main source of energy.<br>
        </blockquote>
       <dl class="works">
         
       <dt>  How It Works?</dt>
          
       <dd> 
           Low carb diets are based on eating unlimited amounts of protein and fat, while severely limiting your carb intake.<br> 
           When carb intake is very low, fatty acids are moved into the blood and transported to the liver, where some of <br>
           them are turned into ketons. The body can then use fatty acids and ketones in the absence of carbs as its primary 
           energy source.</dd> 
       <dt> Weight Loss</dt>
          
       <dd> 
           Numerous studies show low-carb diets are extremely helpful for weight loss, espcially in overweight and obese individuals.<br> 
           Low-carb diets seem to be very effective at reducing dangerous belly fat, which can become lodged around your organs. <br>
           Many studies have found that ketogenic diets lead to more than twice the weight losee of a low-carb , calorie-restricted diet.</dd>
       <dt>The downside</dt>
         
           <dd>
               Low-carb diets do not suit everyone. Some may feel great on them, while others will feel miserable.<br> In extremely rare cases, very low-carb diets can cause a serious condition called ketoacidosis. <br>
               This condition seems to be more common in lactating women and can be fatal if left untreated. <br>
               However , low-carb diets are safe for the majority of people.</dd>
